-> Python is an interpreted(quick i.e. no compilation step),
functional and object oriented high level language.
-> It has a simple syntax and it can be deployed fast as it contains several Fast-inbuilt libraries.
-> Why to use Python?
    Because it is easy to learn/use, performance is high, rapid development, dynamically types
    i.e, we do not need to specify the data type (it will decide automatically in the run time),
    community is huge and python can easily integrate with third party libraries i.e, CherryPy, 
    boto etc. (A complete list can be found at pythonanywhere.com/batteries_included).

-> Instead of {} for a block of code in other programming languages, we use indentation.
-> Indentation is nothing but leaving a specific amount of spaces or a tab space while
    grouping a blocl of code.
    For example:
        x = int(input("Enter min number"))
        y = int(input("Enter max number"))
        i = x
        if i%2 == 0: i=x+1
        while i<=y:
            print(i) #Indentation
            i += 2  #Indentation
    * General convention is to use 4 spaces. The number of spaces should be same throughout the
    project.

-> When we work in real time applications we also need to hold on to multiple values or a sequence
    of values at a time which could be coming from a database table or from a restful
    webservice call or from some other source.
    For that, we use collections: List, Set and Dictionary.
    List:
    The list can store any number of values or objects dynamically and it maintains their order.
    Set: 
    It doesn't allow duplicates. The set and list have a lot of methods to deal with the CRUD of
    the elements.
    Dictionary:
    It's a map. It's used to store keys and values and has separate methods for that.
